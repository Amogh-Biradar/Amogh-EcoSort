Waste management is a critical global challenge, necessitating innovative solutions to efficiently categorize and process different types of waste. This project presents a comprehensive waste segregation system employing the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 classification model. The primary objectives of the project are to accurately identify and classify waste into three distinct categories: e-waste, recyclable waste, and trash. The YOLOv8 model is used for its real-time object detection capabilities, enabling swift and precise recognition of objects within images and video frames. Training data comprised a diverse dataset encompassing various waste items, ensuring robust model generalization. The model was fine-tuned to specifically recognize e-waste, recyclables, and general trash items, enhancing its applicability to practical waste segregation scenarios.
